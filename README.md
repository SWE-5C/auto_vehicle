This project is a web application designed for the Gainesville Autonomous Vehicles project by the University of Florida 
Transportation Institute 
The web application can be accessed by any individual to learn more about the Autonomous Vehicle project and track the autonomous vehicles
in real time on an embedded map. Users that have accounts on the web app will have access to a supplemental survey and admins have the ability
to change surveys, view user testimonials, and view survey data.
